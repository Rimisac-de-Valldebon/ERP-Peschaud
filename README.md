# ERP-Peschaud

Welcome to the Future of ERP-Peschaud!



Here is the Method to the Madness: 

1. Project Structure: Organize your project files and directories to accommodate future expansion. Consider using a structure like:

    ERP-Peschaud/
    ├── config/
    │   ├── config.js
    │   └── config.example.js
    ├── controllers/
    ├── models/
    ├── routes/
    ├── public/
    │   ├── index.html
    │   ├── welcome.html
    │   └── error.html
    ├── views/
    ├── middleware/
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── package.json
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── server.js
    └── README.md


2. Environment Variables: Use environment variables for configuration, especially for sensitive data like database credentials. You can use the dotenv package to manage these.





3. Database Integration: Plan for database integration. Choose a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and set up a connection. Use an ORM like Sequelize (for SQL databases) or Mongoose (for MongoDB) to manage database interactions.
4. Modularize Code: Separate concerns by creating modules for different functionalities. For example, move authentication logic to a separate controller or service file.
5. Routing: Use Express Router to manage routes in a modular way. Create a routes directory and define routes in separate files.

6. Security: Implement security best practices:
-  Use HTTPS in production.
- Hash passwords using libraries like bcrypt.
- Implement input validation and sanitization.
- Use helmet to set secure HTTP headers.

7. Testing: Set up a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to write unit and integration tests.

8. Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging using a library like winston and consider setting up monitoring for your application.

9. Documentation: Keep your README.md updated with setup instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines. Consider using tools like Swagger for API documentation.

10. Version Control: Use branches for feature development and maintain a clear commit history. Consider using GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool for automated testing and deployment.
By implementing these changes, you'll create a solid foundation for your ERP system, making it easier to scale and maintain as it grows.
